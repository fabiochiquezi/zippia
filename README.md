# Zippia Test

https://github.com/fabiochiquezi/zippia-2nd

### To use

-   **yarn install** or **npm install**
-   **yarn dev** or **npm dev**

### Considerations

-   I used one of my boilerplates that already comes with some tools configured to start the project (https://github.com/fabiochiquezi/ToolBoilerplate-NextFirebase). I hope this is not a problem.
-   I separated the project into folders according to the nature of the files.
-   These last two days I was a little busy, so I built the project in parts.
-   Thought I'd add tests with jest/cypress to improve. However, because of time I will send it like this for now. If that's not an issue, I'll add the tests later here in this repository
